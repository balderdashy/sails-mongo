# MongoAdapter

Waterline adapter for MongoDB.

## Installation

Install from NPM.

```bash
$ npm install sails-mongo
```

## Sails Configuration

Add the mongo config to the config/adapters.js file:

```javascript
module.exports.adapters = {
  'default': 'mongo',

  mongo: {
    module   : 'sails-mongo',
    host     : 'localhost',
    db       : '<your mongo db name here>'
  }
};
```

## Sails.js

## Waterline

[Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) is a brand new kind of storage and retrieval engine.

It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs. That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in MySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.
