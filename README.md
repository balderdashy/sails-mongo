# sails-mongo

Sails.js/Waterline adapter for MongoDB.

> Provides easy access to MongoDB from Sails.js & Waterline.
> This module is a Sails/Waterline adapter maintained by the core team.  Its goal is to provide robust, easy-to-use access to MongoDB from Sails.js and Waterline.
>
> As an adapter, this module implements a set of declarative interfaces, conventions, and best-practices for integrating with Mongo databases.
> Strict adherence to an adapter specification enables the (re)use of built-in generic test suites, standardized documentation, reasonable expectations around the API for your users, and overall, a more pleasant development experience for everyone.

#### Special thanks

Thanks so much to Ted Kulp ([@tedkulp](https://twitter.com/tedkulp)) and Robin Persson ([@prssn](https://twitter.com/prssn)) for building the first version of this adapter back in 2013.  Since then, it has evolved into a core adapter within the framework.
