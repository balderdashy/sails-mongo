# MongoAdapter

Waterline adapter for MongoDB.

> **Warning**
>
> `sails-mongo` maps the logical `id` attribute to the required `_id` physical-layer mongo id.
> In the current version of `sails-mongo`, you **should not** sort by `id`.

## Installation

Install from NPM.

```bash
$ npm install sails-mongo --save
```

## Sails Configuration

Add the mongo config to the `config/adapters.js` file.

### Using with Sails v0.9.x

```javascript
module.exports.adapters = {
  'default': 'mongo',

  mongo: {
    module: 'sails-mongo',
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 27017,
    user: 'username',
    password: 'password',
    database: 'your mongo db name here',
    wlNext: {
      caseSensitive: false
    }
  }
};
```

*Note: You can also use the old `v0.8.x` syntax as well, see next section for details.*

Replication/Replica Set can be setup by adding the following options to the `mongo` object,
with your own replica details specified:

```javascript
replSet: {
  servers: [
    {
      host: 'secondary1.localhost',
      port: 27017 // Will override port from default config (optional)
    },
    {
      host: 'secondary2.localhost',
      port: 27017
    }
  ],
  options: {} // See http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-generated/replset.html (optional)
}
```

*Note: Replica set configuration is optional.*

### Using with Sails v0.8.x

```javascript
module.exports.adapters = {
  'default': 'mongo',

  mongo: {
    module: 'sails-mongo',
    url: 'mongodb://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB'
  }
};
```

Don't forget that Mongo uses the ObjectId type for ids.

## Waterline

[Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) is a brand new kind of storage and retrieval engine.

It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs. That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in MySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.
